* GENERAL
** RequireJS sourcemap
** UglifyJS sourcemap has sources=?
** Sourcemap's file should be src, not map?
** clean-css or cssmin or uglifycss operation, with sourcemap support
** write should smartly update sourcemap based on filename (e.g. after rename, hash)

** fix dirty MultiStep hack
** fix leaking monitor() promises and gaze()

** handle RequireJS paths config somehow

** for ALL operations, record any watched file, also Pipeline.js
** exclude internal operations (finalisation) from step chain?
** compose pipelines by name?

** pass each resource individually through steps, not as a F[L[Resource]]
** use "Observables"? fire on find, then on changes

** first-order support for files, incl/excl, glob?

** proxy options explicitly?

** use Harmony modules and other patterns (let, etc)?
** add tests!


* LESS
** compress or sourcemaps? vs concat?

* REQUIRE
** split out uglification?

* JSHINT
** cleaner output, retval

* LODASH
** cleaner options, code

* UGLIFY
** don't rely on there being an abs path

* KARMA
* GLUE

* usage:
**  plumber <pipelines ...> -- <files>
