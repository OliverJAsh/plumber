* GENERAL
** Concat: if source abspath missing?
** SourceMap helpers, remove manipulation code from operations
** RequireJS: record dependencies in supervisor

** fix dirty MultiStep hack, flatten sub-pipelines (unless all())
** fix leaking monitor() promises and gaze()

** handle RequireJS paths config somehow

** supervisor: register Pipeline.js
** supervisor: jshint - reads jshintrc? register too if so
** supervisor: automatically register based on source map?

** exclude internal operations (finalisation) from step chain?
** compose pipelines by name? by reference?

** pass each resource individually through steps, not as a F[L[Resource]]
** use "Observables"? fire on find, then on changes

** first-order support for files, incl/excl, glob?

** proxy options explicitly?

** wrap each operation with catch to report what step caused the error

** use Harmony modules and other patterns (let, etc)?
** add tests!

** input files can be provided to the CLI, programmatic or configured
** sensible defaults, incl config packs (for dev, prod)


* JSHINT
** cleaner output, retval

* LODASH
** cleaner options, code

* KARMA
* MOCHA
* GLUE

* usage:
**  plumber <pipelines ...> -- <files>
